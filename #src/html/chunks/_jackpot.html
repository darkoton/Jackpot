                        If for 10 minutes no buy of minimum approximately 0.1 BNB worth of $LAS occurs, 55.55% of the
                        jackpot wallet gets cashed out. Both BNB in the contract and the LAS tokens that are still not
                        converted into BNB are take into account for the cash-out.
